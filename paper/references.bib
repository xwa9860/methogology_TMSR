  abstract = {A neutronic module for the solution of two-dimensional steady-state multigroup diffusion problems in nuclear reactor cores is developed. The module can produce both direct fluxes as well as adjoints, that is, neutron importances. Different numerical schemes are employed. A standard finite-difference approach is firstly implemented, mainly to serve as a reference for less computationally challenging schemes, such as nodalmethods and boundary elementmethods, which are considered in the second part of the work. The validation of the methods proposed is carried out by comparisons of results for reference structures. In particular a critical problem for a homogeneous reactor for which an analytical solution exists is considered as a benchmark. The computational module is then applied to a fast spectrum system, having physical characteristics similar to the proposed lead- cooled ELSY project. The results show the effectiveness of the numerical techniques presented. The flexibility and the possibility to obtain neutron importances allow the use of the module for parametric studies, design assessments, and integral parameter evaluations as well as for future sensitivity and perturbation analyses and as a shape solver for time-dependent procedures.},

abstract = {This paper studies the numerical treatment of the inter-pebble regions in the modeling of a packed bed geometry for the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of a pebble bed reactor (PBR) core, where the pebbles are physically in contact with each other. In some studies, the inter-pebble regions have been approximated with gaps, in consideration of the problems on mesh quality or economy of the CFD calculation. To examine such a methodology, a sensitivity analysis for the gap size was conducted with two spherical pebbles, where the inter-pebble region was modeled by means of two kinds of inter-pebble gap and two kinds of direct contact. The cases of direct contact showed numerous differences in the results of the flow regime around the pebbles as well as in the wake, compared to the cases of the inter-pebble gap. No large differences were found between the two cases of direct contact. Based on the result of the sensitivity analysis, the two cases of inter-pebble modeling, i.e., the 1-mm gap and area-contact, were applied to the PBR simulation. It was concluded that the flow regimes and their relevant flow-induced local heat transfer were significantly dependent on the modeling of the inter-pebble region.},

Mathematically, this requires solving a system of coupled, nonlinear, stiff, Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). This paper deals with the verification aspects associated with a multiphysics code, i.e.; the substantiation that the mathematical description of the multiphysics equations are solved correctly (in time and space). Multiphysics applications have the added complexity that the solution field participates in various physics components, potentially yielding spatial and/or temporal coupling errors. We present a multiphysics framework that tightly couples the various physical models using the Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov technique (JFNK) and show that high-order convergence can be achieved in both space and time.

@article{Miroliaei2011,
abstract = {Abstract−Fixed bed reactors are among the most important equipment in chemical industries as these are used in chemical processes. An accurate insight into the fluid flow in these reactors is necessary for their modeling. The pressure drop and heat transfer coefficient have been studied for the fixed bed reactor with tube to particle diameter ratio (N) of 4.6 and comprising 130 spherical particles using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The simulations were carried out in a wide range of Reynolds number: 3.85≤Re≤611.79. The RNG k-$\epsilon$ turbulence model was used in the turbulent regime. The CFD results were compared with empirical correlations in the literature. The predicted pressure drop values in laminar flow were overestimated compared with the Ergun's [27] correlation and underestimated in the turbulent regime due to the wall friction and the flow channeling in the bed, respectively. It was observed that the CFD results of the pressure drop are in good agreement with the correlations of Zhavoronkov et al. [28] and Reichelt [29] because the wall effects have been taken into account in these correlations. Values of the predicted dimensionless heat transfer coefficient showed better agreement with the Dixon and Labua's [32] correlation. This is explained by the fact that this correlation is a function of the particle size and shape in the bed.},

@book{Rasmussen2006,
abstract = {Gaussian processes (GPs) are natural generalisations of multivariate Gaussian random variables to infinite (countably or continuous) index sets. GPs have been applied in a large number of fields to a diverse range of ends, and very many deep theoretical analyses of various properties are available. This paper gives an introduction to Gaussian processes on a fairly elementary level with special emphasis on characteristics relevant in machine learning. It draws explicit connections to branches such as spline smoothing models and support vector machines in which similar ideas have been investigated. Gaussian process models are routinely used to solve hard machine learning problems. They are attractive because of their flexible non-parametric nature and computational simplicity. Treated within a Bayesian framework, very powerful statistical methods can be implemented which offer valid estimates of uncertainties in our predictions and generic model selection procedures cast as nonlinear optimization problems. Their main drawback of heavy computational scaling has recently been alleviated by the introduction of generic sparse approximations.13,78,31 The mathematical literature on GPs is large and often uses deep concepts which are not required to fully understand most machine learning applications. In this tutorial paper, we aim to present characteristics of GPs relevant to machine learning and to show up precise connections to other "kernel machines" popular in the community. Our focus is on a simple presentation, but references to more detailed sources are provided.},
